# PathFinding
 Path Finding project for the AI course implementing different heuristics search algorithms such as:
 - A*
 - Bi-directional A*
 - Iterative-deepening A* (IDA*)
 - Uniform cost search (UCS)
 - Iteratve-deepening search (IDS)

### _Overview:_
The objective is to calculate and get the path with minimum cost from given points A to B with given grid and different step cost for each area.

We also implemented a GUI to see how each algorithm runs on a given grid and obstacles.
